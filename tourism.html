<h3>&#8594China has the world’s largest outbound tourism industry. In 2018, more than 140 million outbound tourists traveled to different parts of the world. Tourism to India, however, is still below potential. In 2018, India received around 225,000 Chinese tourists. The renewal of the bilateral MoU on Cooperation in Tourism Sector was completed in May 2015. India Tourism has established an office in Beijing. In 2018, Mr. KJ Alphons, Minister of State for Tourism visited China in August 2018 and held roadshows in Beijing, Wuhan, Guangzhou and Shanghai. The roadshows were highly attended and generated a lot of interest from Chinese Tour operators.

&#8594India-China MoU on Audio-visual coproduction was signed during Chinese President Xi Jinping’s visit to India in September 2014 and two Indian movies (PK and Dhoom3) were released in 2015. “Xuan Zang” was the first co-production film between India and China, featuring popular Chinese Huang Xiaoming. This film released in 2016 was submitted as a contender to represent mainland China for Best Foreign Language Film at the 89th Academy Awards in 2017. In 2017, “Kungfu Yoga”,  featuring Jackie Chan and “Buddies in India” was released. In recent years, Indian movies such as Dangal, Secret Superstar, Bahubali, Hindi Medium, Toilet, Andhadhun etc, registered great success at the Chinese box office.<br><br>
&#8594The number of visits made by Chinese to India registered robust growth during the first three quarters of this year, making India a trendy destination for Chinese tourists, according to a report published by China's online travel agency Ctrip.
<br><br>
&#8594Data from Ctrip showed that the number of visits made by Chinese to India surged by over 70 percent during the January-September period, with over 60 percent of the travelers in their thirties or forties.
<br><br>
&#8594Compared with other traditional overseas travel destinations, India remained a niche for most Chinese, a Ctrip product manager said, adding that as Chinese people learn more about India, reservations for package tours have seen an increase of over 40 percent.
<br><br>
&#8594Indian tourism products continued to increase, as tour operators rolled out diversified traveling routes and products, allowing travelers to make Buddhist pilgrimages, celebrate the Hindu spring festival and visit shooting locations of Chinese movies.
<br><br>
&#8594According to the Embassy of India in Beijing, electronic visa policies for Chinese citizens were relaxed starting from October, including lower visa fees and extended validity.
<br><br>
&#8594The new policies will benefit hundreds of thousands of people, further stimulating Chinese travelers' enthusiasm to visit India, a Ctrip employee estimated.
<br><br>
&#8594Under the new policy, Chinese citizens only need to pay $80 for a multiple-entry electronic visa valid for five years and $25 for a single-entry visa valid for 30 days.
<br><br>
&#8594In the first three quarters of this year, Chinese travelers spent an average of 649 yuan (about $91.8) on their visas to India, Ctrip data showed.
